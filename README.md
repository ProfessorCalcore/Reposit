# üêâPYTHON CALCULATORüêâ

# Introduction
Hi this is a basic calculator i made as a beginner software developer. It lets you add, multiply, divide or subtract 2 numbers together.

# How do i even run the script bro

Ok first of all. Github does not have a way to run scripts (the code) on here. You need to download a python runtime environment. PRE.

A PRE is basically an app that lets you run code using the python syntax language. Step 1 tells you how to download a PRE.

# STEPS: üé¢
1) If on Android : Download 'Pydroid' from the app store.
2) Copy or download the main script file (not me the big one) and load the file onto the PRE. Then the blank editor should now have magically summoned my code.
3) Now that the code is loaded you press run and Boom you got a calculator.

‚ùóDO NOT MESS WITH THE CODE IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AS U MAY CREATE AN ERROR YOU STRUGGLE TO DEBUG‚ùó
